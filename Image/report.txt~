Part 1:  version control (10 points)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+4 Evidence of a repository (aka URL)
https://github.com/adriangerbaud/FinalProject

+6 code that you have checked in that matches at least one chosen task done by you

My code makes a disembodided Prof. Emrich head move around the screen, as mentioned in my rubric. (with a little tweaks, of course)


Part 2: Documentation (inc. lab report)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will be following Ethan's suggestion to keep my reports shorter this time. 

+8 Explains how what you completed works internally.

After intializng the SDL window, I invoke an Image object that is loaded with an image in my Image directory. The move method is used to move the image around using the arrows on the keyboard. The screen is filled with with a solid color, and then the image is added to the screen. The screen is updated and everything is displayed. A timer is used to cap the frame rate.


+8 Explains how what you completed was/were verified.

The verification of this program is very straightforward. I basically ran the the program, made sure everything appeared on the screen as I inteded, moved the Emrich around and tested the endpoints of the screen. The image runs off the screen to the right and down as I intended. Pressing the X at the top of the window exits the program.



+30 A time log of what you worked on for the project (6 pts per hour spent <= 5).
This google doc keeps track of the hours logged for my group.

+4 A draft rubric for next weekâ€™s lab that continues this development effort, but is for 80 points and hopefully is more involved. If you decide to move a task to next week, please detail in your report why and how we might be able to help overcome technical issues encountered.


Rubric

Part 1:
+30 Create a window that will display the background of the football field.

Part 2:
+50 Add a player on the screen and move him around using clips and sprites


No tasks were moved to next week because they were either completed or became obsolete when we changed project idea.

Part 3: lab deliverables ( up to 20 points)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain why you should receive these 20 additional points for this lab.  You can either directly reference the rubric you prepared the first week of March, the related but alternative development goals, or other tasks not mentioned in lab but move your project substantially forward.  We encourage you to brag about how you solved an important problem, something you may have learned during this period by working on the project, or how what you have done lays the foundation for success later in the semester.

 
We spoke with professor Emrich and our project has changed. It is therefore obsolute to  















Doing tutorials for a large portion of this lab is acceptable, but you need to complete one compilable component.  If this does not compile you may still receive up to 20 points if you explain what issues you have and how we (instructor and TAs) can help.
